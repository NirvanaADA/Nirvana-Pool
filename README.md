      <b>Moderate Fees</b><br><br>
We are setting our fees on a moderate level — 1.5 % + 340  fixed (min. fixed possible) — to cover our basic operational costs plus something extra to make it sustainable.         However, the majority of the rewards are going to our delegators.

          <b>Connectivity</b><br><br>
We have the Stakepool setup on an Cloud-Server. Stake Pools deployed in Data Centers, benefit from statistically higher internet connectivity reliability then Stake Pools deployed individually using home internet connections.
